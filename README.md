- ✨ Hi, I’m @voidae
- I'm a pursuing student, Computer Sciences.
- I have basic knowledge in Java, C#, and Python (and also other basics like HTML, CSS, and Javascript).
- Looking on to collaborate in any organised application development project. I just need a team to work with. Might be helpful in extending knowledge. 
- You can contact me on email - voidd.ae@gmail.com , or my instagram account - @saadisntreal ✨
